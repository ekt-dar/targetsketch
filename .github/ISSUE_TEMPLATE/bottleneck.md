## Benchmarks

How poorly does `targets` perform? To find out, we recommend the [`proffer`](https://github.com/wlandau/proffer) package and take screenshots of the results displayed in your browser.

```r
library(targetsketch)
library(proffer)
px <- pprof({
  # All your targets code goes here.
})
```
